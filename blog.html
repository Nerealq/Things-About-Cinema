The star-studded science fiction film will be screened on September 3, at wich time we will be able to see the first reactions to this so very long awaited Warner bros and Legendary Pictures production and it's excpected to become one of the best titles of the season.</p>
            <p>Adaptation of Frank Herbert's influential novel (very recomenden to read), the film has brought together an impressive cast of stars, including Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista, Sharon Duncan, Stephen McKinley, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem. The story follows Paul Atreides, a brilliant and talented young man who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to secure the future of his family and his people.

               <h2>Carefurl, Possible Spoilers Ahead!</h2>

            <p>Loki is a Disney+ Original Series from Marvel Studios in which the volatile villain Loki ( the wonderful Tom Hiddleston) reprises his role as the God of Mischief in a series that takes place after the events of the epic film adventure Avengers:Endgame.</p>
            <p>  The series premiered on June 9 on Disney+, and after the launc of its first episode it continues with a new weekly epiosde.</p>
            <p> Loki is the third series of the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe after Scarlet Witch and Vision and Falcon and the Winter Soldier.This new series breaks the schemes of other platforms to release all its episode in marathon, but maintains the premiere rythm that its predecessors had, releasing a weekly episode so that we can gradually dose all the infromation they present to us adn also apreciate all the effort made to carry out a great production that can become even more viral.</p>
            <p> For me, it's the greatest series of the trhee that Marvel has done. Despite being called a villian I see myself interested in this character so much and I cannot wait to see the upcoming episodes. We also have to highlight all the connections and secret symbol that this series have with all the Marvel Universe and with the future phase and movies that are driving all of us crazy. </p>

            <p>Moving images are everywhere today and we can even imagine a world without video and without internet but this wasn't always like this...</p>
            <p> The first motion pictures arrived early in the 20th Century, typically with a running time of a few seconds to a couple of minutes. The first films were released in 1894 with Edison's Kinetoscope, wich was designed to be viewed by one individual at a time. Now, it's so easy to watch things on hbo or on tv but before the 1900, what was the scenario?</p>
            <p><i>"Fred Otts Sneeze"</i> is the first motion picture, produced in 1894 by Edison Studios, with a running time of 5 seconds. Human life was revolutionized by the advent of photography several decades earlier, and now those image were coming to life, This was magical technology and a big deal to people. An luckily we can enjoy cinema in veary easy and incredible ways.</p>
